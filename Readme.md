"Cyberdecks are required if you want to run the "real" Net, in three dimensions.
Cyberdecks allow for the use of Plugs, which are a type of implant that allows
for a direct neural link to the Cyberdeck. This allows the user to experience
a fully immersive 3D world. Because it is so much more intuitive, the user can
accomplish things much faster." - Cyberpunk 2020 fandom
